# Find The Penguins
It is javaScript based web game. The main objective is to find the eight Penguins in the nine boxes. There is also a Yeti whom if encountered the game will be over.

inspired from https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/pop_up_penguins/

I have randomized the appearance of the Penguins and the Yeti.
